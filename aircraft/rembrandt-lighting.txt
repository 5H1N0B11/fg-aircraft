Everyone knows the further a light source is from an object the less it illuminates an object. 

This comes from a simple phenomenon: energy conservation. Each amount of energy radiated by the light source in an amount of time has to travel further from the source. Thus each amount of light energy radiated by a source is found distributed over a sphere that grows as a function of time. The surface area of this sphere grows with the square of the distance. So each point of an object that receives light receives an amount decreased with the square of its distance from the source, hence the factor mitigating ~ = e / d ^ 2 [1].

Now we can also consider the transparency of the air also reduces. There are very complicated formulas. For simplicity we introduce a parameter to attenuate depending on the distance and a constant parameter. You recognized the <c> settings <l> and <q> to <constant>, <line> and <square> (meaning "square"). Hence the final formula attenuation = 1 / (<c> + (<l> * d) + (<q> * d * d)), <q> is in the equation [1] 1 / e, e energy generated by the source. Of course, energy is modulated by the color of the source.

How to choose the settings: <c> nonzero avoids a division by zero when the distance is zero. It adjusts the illumination of nearby objects. <q> is the inverse of the energy produced by the source. So over the source, the greater <q> should be small. In that you modulate with <l>, but it can remain at zero.

For spots, there is the added attenuation. If you light with a torch, you produce a stronger circle of light in the center than at its edges. This is what represents the <exponent> (exponent in French). The trick used not physical at all, is a function that varies between 0 and 1 with the angle to the direction of the spot. In the mentioned direction, that is the only attenuation is that depending on the distance described above. If we move away from that direction, the cosine of the angle will go from 1 (zero degree) to 0 (90 °) and can be negative when you point behind you, if that does not work in Rembrandt. So no physical function used is: attenuation = (cos angle) ^ (<exponent>). I made plots of attenuation depending on the angle of <exponent> different:

You see that over the exhibitor, the higher the curve is narrow around the axis of the spot, so the light is more concentrated. If the exponent is smaller, the edges are more informed.
But as a flashlight has an edge, a spot has a <cutoff>. This is the angle from which there is no light at all. If you choose a strong exponent, it may be that the angle of "cut" (cutoff), there have been more light at all, and in this case the transition will be gradual. If the attenuation is not zero at that angle, the transition will be as hard as a prosecution show.
