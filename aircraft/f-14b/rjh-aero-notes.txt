F14 Aero notes: (rjh@zaretto.com)

Estimated
* All negative alpha values have been estimated; generally using NASA CR-1756 747-100 (Boeing D6039643 VolII) and data from F15 (flightgear Erik Hofman) been used as a guide and to calculate typical coefficient increments where no data is available; so for flaps I've taken the 747 coefficient increments; scaled them accordingly (for flap angle and a slight tuning factor) to get values that I think are applicable for an F14. Also 
* Flap increments
* Gear increments
* Speedbrake.
* Stores coefficients
* Sweep is calculated as a factor based on values in NASA TN-D6909
* Slats based on (Cl,Cd,CM)  - based loosely on adg.stanford.edu/aa241/highlift/clmaxest.html with some tuning and guesstimation
* Mach number affects are applied as a simple factor (based on Cl value differences) and applied to all forces/moments. This doesn't accurately model the transonic region and probably isn't accurate for each invdividual coefficient group but until I find some more data it is all I've got to work with.

Things that are definitely missing;
* PQR Cross coupling (CNP, CNR etc) effects does not take into account flap deflection
* Spoilers; not sure if these affect roll or whether this is in the CxDA values. Will probably just model as a change to lift, pitch and drag.
